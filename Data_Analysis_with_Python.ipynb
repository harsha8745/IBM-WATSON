An application programming interface is a set of functions that you can call to get access to some type of servers. The SQL API consists of library function calls as an application programming interface, API, for the DBMS. To pass SQL statements to the DBMS, an application program calls functions in the API, and it calls other functions to retrieve query results and status information from the DBMS. The basic operation of a typical SQL API is illustrated in the figure. The application program begins its database access with one or more API calls that connect the program to the DBMS. To send the SQL statement to the DBMS, the program builds the statement as a text string in a buffer and then makes an API call to pass the buffer contents to the DBMS. The application program makes API calls to check the status of its DBMS request and to handle errors. The application program ends its database access with an API call that disconnects it from the database. "

It is a standard that allows you to write a single program that works with multiple kinds of relational databases instead of writing a separate program for each one. So, if you learn the DB-API functions, then you can apply that knowledge to use any database with Python. The two main concepts in the Python DB-API are connection objects and query objects. You use connection objects to connect to a database and manage your transactions. Cursor objects are used to run queries. You open a cursor object and then run queries. The cursor works similar to a cursor in a text processing system where you scroll down in your result set and get your data into the application. Cursors are used to scan through the results of a database. Here are the methods used with connection objects. The cursor() method returns a new cursor object using the connection. The commit() method is used to commit any pending transaction to the database. The rollback() method causes the database to roll back to the start of any pending transaction. The close() method is used to close a database connection. \n",
        "\n",
        ">Let's walk through a Python application that uses the DB-API to query a database. First, you import your database module by using the connect API from that module. To open a connection to the database, you use the connection function and pass in the parameters that is the database name, username, and password. The connect function returns connection object. After this, you create a cursor object on the connection object. The cursor is used to run queries and fetch results. After running the queries using the cursor, we also use the cursor to fetch the results of the query. Finally, when the system is done running the queries, it frees all resources by closing the connection. Remember that it is always important to close connections to avoid unused connections taking up resources.\n"

As an example, suppose we have some entries that have missing values for the normalized losses column and the column average for entries with data is 4500. While there is no way for us to get an accurate guess of what the missing value is under the normalized losses column should have been, you can approximate their values using the average value of the column 4500. \n",

For example, he may know that the missing values tend to be old cars and the normalized losses of old cars are significantly higher than the average vehicle. \n",

        ">Data normalization is an important technique to understand in data pre-processing. When we take a look at the used car data set, we notice in the data that the feature length ranges from 150-250, while feature width and height ranges from 50-100. We may want to normalize these variables so that the range of the values is consistent. This normalization can make some statistical analyses easier down the road. By making the ranges consistent between variables, normalization enables a fair comparison between the different features, making sure they have the same impact. It is also important for computational reasons. \n",

        ">So, these two features are in very different ranges. When we do further analysis, like linear regression for example, the attribute income will intrinsically influence the result more due to its larger value. But this doesn't necessarily mean it is more important as a predictor. So, the nature of the data biases the linear regression model to weigh income more heavily than age. To avoid this, we can normalize these two variables into values that range from zero to one. Compare the two tables at the right. After normalization, both variables now have a similar influence on the models we will build later."
