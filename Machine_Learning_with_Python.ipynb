For example, its clump thickness is 6, its uniformity of cell size is 1, its marginal adhesion is 1, and so on. One of the interesting questions we can ask, at this point is: Is this a benign or malignant cell? In contrast with a benign tumor, a malignant tumor is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body, and diagnosing it early might be the key to a patient’s survival. One could easily presume that only a doctor with years of experience could diagnose that tumor and say if the patient is developing cancer or not. Right? Well, imagine that you’ve obtained a dataset containing characteristics of thousands of human cell samples extracted from patients who were believed to be at risk of developing cancer. Analysis of the original data showed that many of the characteristics differed significantly between benign and malignant samples. You can use the values of these cell characteristics in samples from other patients to give an early indication of whether a new sample might be benign or malignant. You should clean your data, select a proper algorithm for building a prediction model, and train your model to understand patterns of benign or malignant cells within the data. Once the model has been trained by going through data iteratively, it can be used to predict your new or unknown cell with a rather high accuracy. This is machine learning! It is the way that a machine learning model can do a doctor’s task or at least help that doctor make the process faster."

        ">Let me explain what I mean when I say “without being explicitly programmed.” Assume that you have a dataset of images of animals such as cats and dogs, and you want to have software or an application that can recognize and differentiate them. The first thing that you have to do here is interpret the images as a set of feature sets. For example, does the image show the animal’s eyes? If so, what is their size? Does it have ears? What about a tail? How many legs? Does it have wings? Prior to machine learning, each image would be transformed to a vector of features. Then, traditionally, we had to write down some rules or methods in order to get computers to be intelligent and detect the animals. But, it was a failure. Why? Well, as you can guess, it needed a lot of rules, highly dependent on the current dataset, and not generalized enough to detect out-of-sample cases. This is when machine learning entered the scene. Using machine learning, allows us to build a model that looks at all the feature sets, and their corresponding type of animals, and it learns the pattern of each animal. It is a model built by machine learning algorithms. It detects without explicitly being programmed to do so. In essence, machine learning follows the same process that a 4-year-old child uses to learn, understand, and differentiate animals. So, machine learning algorithms, inspired by the human learning process, iteratively learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights. These models help us in a variety of tasks, such as object recognition, summarization, recommendation, and so on."

How do you think banks make a decision when approving a loan application? They use machine learning to predict the probability of default for each applicant, and then approve or refuse the loan application based on that probability. Telecommunication companies use their customers’ demographic data to segment them, or predict if they will unsubscribe from their company the next month.

A Classification technique is used for Predicting the class or category of a case, for example, if a cell is benign or malignant, or whether or not a customer will churn. Clustering groups of similar cases, for example, can find similar patients, or can be used for customer segmentation in the banking field. Association technique is used for finding items or events that often co-occur, for example, grocery items that are usually bought together by a particular customer. Anomaly detection is used to discover abnormal and unusual cases, for example, it is used for credit card fraud detection. Sequence mining is used for predicting the next event, for instance, the click-stream in websites. Dimension reduction is used to reduce the size of data. And finally, recommendation systems, this associates people's preferences with others who have similar tastes, and recommends new items to them, such as books or movies. "

In brief, AI tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humans. So, Artificial Intelligence is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization. Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligence. It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations. And Deep Learning is a very special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. Deep learning involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorithms. "

You have to split your dataset into train and test sets to train your model and then test the model's accuracy separately. SciKit Learn can split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets for you in one line of code. Then you can set up your algorithm. For example, you can build a classifier using a support vector classification algorithm. We call our estimator instance CLF and initialize its parameters. Now you can train your model with the train set by passing our training set to the fit method, the CLF model learns to classify unknown cases. Then we can use our test set to run predictions, and the result tells us what the class of each unknown value is. Also, you can use the different metrics to evaluate your model accuracy. For example, using a confusion matrix to show the results. And finally, you save your model."

The question is: given this data set can we predict the co2 emission of a car using other fields such as engine size or cylinders? Let's assume we have some historical data from different cars and assume that a car such as in row 9 has not been manufactured yet, but we're interested in estimating its approximate co2 emission after production. Is it possible? We can use regression methods to predict a continuous value such as co2 emission using some other variables. Indeed regression is the process of predicting a continuous value. In regression there are two types of variables: a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The dependent variable can be seen as the state, target, or final goal we study and try to predict. And the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, can be seen as the causes of those states. The independent variables are shown conventionally by X and the dependent variable is notated by Y. A regression model relates Y or the dependent variable to a function of X i.e. the independent variables. The key point in the regression is that our dependent value should be continuous and cannot be a discrete value.

We can use linear regression to predict a continuous value such as Co2 emission by using other variables. Linear regression is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variables. In simple linear regression, there are two variables, a dependent variable and an independent variable.

        ">The mean of all residual errors shows how bad the model is representing the data set, it is called the mean squared error, or MSE. Mathematically, MSE can be shown by an equation. While this is not the only way to expose the error of a multiple linear regression model, it is one of the most popular ways to do so. The best model for our data set is the one with minimum error for all prediction values. So, the objective of multiple linear regression is to minimize the MSE equation. "

        ">To minimize it, we should find the best parameters theta, but how? Okay, how do we find the parameter or coefficients for multiple linear regression? There are many ways to estimate the value of these coefficients. However, the most common methods are the ordinary least squares and optimization approach. \r\n",

        "- Ordinary least squares tries to estimate the values of the coefficients by minimizing the mean square error. This approach uses the data as a matrix and uses linear algebra operations to estimate the optimal values for the theta. The problem with this technique is the time complexity of calculating matrix operations as it can take a very long time to finish. When the number of rows in your data set is less than 10,000, you can think of this technique as an option. However, for greater values, you should try other faster approaches.\r\n",
        "- The second option is to use an optimization algorithm to find the best parameters. That is, you can use a process of optimizing the values of the coefficients by iteratively minimizing the error of the model on your training data. For example, you can use ***gradient descent*** which starts optimization with random values for each coefficient, then calculates the errors and tries to minimize it through y's changing of the coefficients in multiple iterations. Gradient descent is a proper approach if you have a large data set. Please understand however, that there are other approaches to estimate the parameters of the multiple linear regression that you can explore on your own. After you find the best parameters for your model, you can go to the prediction phase"

        ">After we found the parameters of the linear equation, making predictions is as simple as solving the equation for a specific set of inputs. Imagine we are predicting CO_2 emission or Y from other variables for the automobile in record number nine. Our linear regression model representation for this problem would be y hat equals theta transpose x. Once we find the parameters, we can plug them into the equation of the linear model. For example, let's use theta zero equals 125, theta one equals 6.2, theta two equals 14, and so on. If we map it to our data set, we can rewrite the linear model as CO_2 emissions equals 125 plus 6.2 multiplied by engine size, plus 14 multiplied by cylinder, and so on.\r\n",

For example, it shows cylinder has higher impact on CO_2 emission amounts in comparison with engine size.

We can predict the CO_2 emission for this specific car would be 214.1.\r\n",

        ">As you saw, you can use multiple independent variables to predict a target value in multiple linear regression. It sometimes results in a better model compared to using a simple linear regression which uses only one independent variable to predict the dependent variable. Now the question is how, many independent variable should we use for the prediction? Should we use all the fields in our data set? Does adding independent variables to a multiple linear regression model always increase the accuracy of the model? Basically, adding too many independent variables without any theoretical justification may result in an overfit model. An overfit model is a real problem because it is too complicated for your data set and not general enough to be used for prediction. So, it is recommended to avoid using many variables for prediction. There are different ways to avoid overfitting a model in regression, however that is outside the scope of this video. The next question is, should independent variables be continuous? Basically, categorical independent variables can be incorporated into a regression model by converting them into numerical variables. For example, given a binary variables such as car type, the code dummy zero for manual and one for automatic cars. As a last point, remember that multiple linear regression is a specific type of linear regression. So, there needs to be a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each of your independent variables. There are a number of ways to check for linear relationship. For example, you can use scatter plots and then visually checked for linearity. If the relationship displayed in your scatter plot is not linear, then you need to use non-linear regression."
