        ">In this video, we will start talking about deep learning and how the recent advances in the field have led to amazing and mind-blowing applications. I am sure that you are aware that deep learning is one of the hottest subjects in data science, if not the hottest, especially with the tremendous amount of fascinating projects that are surfacing with the help of deep learning; projects which people deemed almost impossible with just a little over a decade ago. Therefore, there is a lot of excitement about deep learning. In this video, I will share with you some amazing and recent applications of deep learning that will hopefully inspire and motivate you even more about deep learning. \r\n",

        ">The first amazing application is color restoration, where a given image in greyscale is automatically turned into a colored one. A group of researchers in Japan built a system using convolutional neural networks that can take a grayscale image, like these ones, and add life to them by turning them into colored ones. You can find many other awesome examples by following this link, which you can also find below the video. \r\n",

        ">Another really cool but double-sworded application is speech enactment, where an audio clip is synthesized with a video, and the lip movements in the video are synced with the sounds and words in the audio clip. Many attempts have been made in the past to build such a system, but many of them produced results that looked uncanny. Recently, a group of researchers at the University of Washington built the first system that generates realistic results by training a recurrent neural network on a large corpus of video data of a single person. The subject of their case study was the former President of the United States, Barack Obama. Let's look at their example. So here is an audio clip from one of Obama's speeches. \"It's been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting in American history.\" The audio clip was synthesized with a video of one of his other speeches, and his lip movements were synced with the words and sounds in the audio clip. Let's take a look. \"It's been less than a week since the deadliest mass shooting in American history.\" Anyone watching the video can't really tell that the video was synthesized. Not only that, but their system is also capable of extracting an audio from a video and syncing the lip movements in another video with the audio from the first video. Let's look at an example of this. \"Especially our friends who were lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. I visited with the families of many of the victims on Thursday and one thing I told them is that they're not alone.\" Your jaw dropped yet? \r\n",

Alex Graves at the University of Toronto used recurrent neural networks to design an algorithm that can rewrite a given message in highly realistic cursive handwriting in a wide variety of styles. So you can type some text in this field and you can either select the style of handwriting to be generated or let the algorithm randomly select it for you.\r\n",

Another application is automatically adding sounds to silent movies, where a deep learning model uses a database of pre-recorded sounds to select a sound to play that best matches what is taking place in the scene. Not to leave out the popular applications of classifying objects in images and self-driving cars. \r\n",

How come all of a sudden they are taking off and becoming very popular with endless applications? In order to answer this question, let's start learning the specifics of neural networks and deep learning."

        ">All the algorithms that are used in deep learning are largely inspired by the way neurons and neural networks function and process data in the brain. This image is one of the very first pictures of a neuron. It was drawn by Santiago Ramon y Cajal, back in 1899 based on what he saw after placing a pigeon's brain under the microscope. He is now known as the father of modern neuroscience, but based on his drawing, the neurons, one of them labeled A, have big bodies in the middle and long arms that stretch out and branch off to connect with other neurons. This other image here is that of a neural network and has a bunch or thousands of neurons in what looks like a brain tissue. Tt gives you a sense of how tightly they are packed together and how many of them are in a small brain tissue\r\n",

        ">Going back to the drawing of neurons by Ramon y Cajal, let's rotate it 90 degrees to the left. I bet this way it is starting to look a little familiar since it slightly resembles drawings of artificial neural networks that you must have seen. Here is a cartoon drawing of the neuron. The main body of the neuron is called the soma, which contains the nucleus of the neuron. The big network of arms sticking out of the body is called the dendrites, and then the long arm that sticks out of the soma in the other direction is called the axon. The whiskers at the end of the axon are called the terminal buttons or synapses. So the dendrites receive electrical impulses which carry information, or data, from sensors or terminal buttons of other adjoining neurons. The dendrites then carry the impulses or data to the soma. In the nucleus, electrical impulses, or the data, are processed by combining them together, and then they are passed on to the axon. The axon then carries the processed information to the terminal button or synapse, and the output of this neuron becomes the input to thousands of other neurons. Learning in the brain occurs by repeatedly activating certain neural connections over others, and this reinforces those connections. This makes them more likely to produce a desired outcome given a specified input. Once the desired outcome occurs, the neural connections causing that outcome become strengthened. \r\n",

        ">An artificial neuron behaves in the same way as a biological neuron. So it consists of a soma, dendrites, and an axon to pass on the output of this neuron to other neurons. The end of the axon can branch off to connect to many other neurons, but for simplicity we are just showing one branch here. The learning process also very much resembles the way learning occurs in the brain as you will see in the next couple of videos. Now that we understand the different parts of an artificial neuron, let's learn how we formulate the way artificial neural networks process information.\r\n",

        ">In this video, we will start learning about the mathematical formulation of neural networks. In the previous video, we established that the shape of an artificial neuron looks like this in order to resemble a real biological neuron. For a network of neurons, we normally divide it into different layers: the first layer that feeds the input into the network is obviously called the input layer. The set of nodes that provide the output of the network is called the output layer. And any sets of nodes in between the input and the output layers are called the hidden layers.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">Forward propagation is the process through which data passes through layers of neurons in a neural network from the input layer all the way to the output layer. Let's use one neuron and mathematically formulate the way information flows through it. As shown here, the data flows through each neuron by connections or the dendrites. Every connection has a specific weight by which the flow of data is regulated. Here x1 and x2 are the two inputs, they could be an integer or float. When these inputs pass through the connections, they're adjusted depending on the connection weights, w1 and w2. The neuron then processes this information by outputting a weighted sum of these inputs. It also adds a constant to the sum which is referred to as the bias. So, z here is the linear combination of the inputs and weights along with the bias, and a is the output of the network. For consistency, we will stick to these letters throughout the course, so z will always represent the linear combination of the inputs, and a will always represent the output of a neuron. However, simply outputting a weighted sum of the inputs limits the tasks that can be performed by the neural network. Therefore, a better processing of the data would be to map the weighted sum to a nonlinear space. A popular function is the sigmoid function, where if the weighted sum is a very large positive number, then the output of the neuron is close to 1, and if the weighted sum is a very large negative number, then the output of the neuron is close to zero. Non-linear transformations like the sigmoid function are called activation functions. Activation functions are another extremely important feature of artificial neural networks. They basically decide whether a neuron should be activated or not. In other words, whether the information that the neuron is receiving is relevant or should be ignored. The takeaway message here is that a neural network without an activation function is essentially just a linear regression model. The activation function performs non-linear transformation to the input enabling the neural network of learning and performing more complex tasks, such as image classifications and language translations. For further simplification, I am going to proceed with a neural network of one neuron and one input\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">Let's go over an example of how to compute the output. Let's say that the value of x1 is 0.1, and we want to predict the output for this input. The network has optimized weight and bias where w1 is 0.15 and b1 is 0.4. The first step is to calculate z, which is the dot product of the inputs and the corresponding weights plus the bias. So we find that z is 0.415. The neuron then uses the sigmoid function to apply non-linear transformation to z. Therefore, the output of the neuron is 0.6023. For a network with two neurons, the output from the first neuron will be the input to the second neuron. The rest is then exactly the same. The second neuron takes the input and computes the dot product of the input, which is a1 in this case, and the weight which is w2, and adds the bias which is b2. Using a sigmoid function as the activation function, the output of the network would be 0.7153. And this would be the predicted value for the input 0.1. This is in essence how a neural network predicts the output for any given input. No matter how complicated the network gets, it is the same exact process. To summarize, given a neural network with a set of weights and biases, you should be able to compute the output of the network for any given input. In the next video, we will start learning how to train a neural network and optimize the weights and the biases.\r\n",

        ">Let's say that we have some data, and here's a scatter plot of the data. For simplicity, I have generated data where z is twice x. And say we want to find the value of w that would generate a line that best fits this data. To do that, we define a cost or a loss function. One common cost or loss function is the one shown here as J, where we take the difference between the z values and the product of w and x's. We square that and we sum the squared difference across all values of z and x. The best value of w would then be the value that results in the minimum value of this cost or loss function. Let's take a look at how this cost function looks like. What makes this loss or cost function attractive is that it is a parabola, and has one global minimum or one unique solution. For the given data, the value of w that makes this cost function minimum, is w equals 2, meaning z equals 2x, which would result in a line that fits the points perfectly. This is a very simplified example as in real world datasets, the target variable z would be dependent on more than one variable and we can't just simply plot the cost function and visually determine the best value of the weights. So how do we determine the best value of w. The best value of w, or w's in case you have many weights to optimize, is determined through an algorithm called gradient descent. Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function. To find the minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point. What does that mean? We start at a random initial value of w. Let's call it w0, and say it's equal to 0.2, and we start taking steps towards the green dot which is w = 2. To determine in which direction to move, we compute the gradient of the loss function at the current value of w, which is 0.2. The gradient is given by the slope of the tangent at w = 0.2, and then the magnitude of the step is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate. The larger the learning rate, the bigger the step we take, and the smaller the learning rate, the smaller the step we take. Then we take the step and we move to w1. w1 is essentially computed as w0 minus the learning rate times the gradient at w0. This represents the first iteration of the algorithm. At w1, we repeat the same process of computing the gradient at w1 and using the same learning rate to control the magnitude of the step towards the minimum. We keep repeating this step again and again until we hit the minimum or a value of the cost function that is very close to the minimum, within a very small predefined threshold. Now when choosing the learning rate, we have to be very careful as a large learning rate can lead to big steps and eventually missing the minimum. On the other hand, a small learning rate can result in very small steps and therefore causing the algorithm to take a long time to find the minimum point. \r\n",

        ">Now let's see how each iteration with a learning rate of 0.4 affects the way the resulting line fits the data on the left. We initialize w to 0, which means z equals 0. It is a horizontal line and therefore the cost is high and the line as you can see is a bad fit. After the 1st iteration, w moves closer to 2 and because the slope is very steep at w=0, the new value of w results in a big drop in the loss function. The resulting line fits better than the initial one but there is still room for improvement. After the 2nd iteration, w continues moving toward w = 2. Because the slope is not as steep as before, the step is not as big but the cost function still drops in value and the resulting line is moving closer to the ideal best fit line. The same observation is noted with the 3rd iteration, and the 4th iteration. After 4 iterations, you can see how we are almost there at w = 2, and the resulting line almost fits the scatterplot perfectly. With each iteration, the weight is updated in a way that's proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point. Therefore, if you initialize the weight to a value that is to the right of the minimum, then the positive gradient will result in w moving to the left towards the minimum. Now that we understand how to optimize a parameter that a function depends on, we are now ready to start learning about backpropagation and how neural networks learn and optimize their weights and biases.\r\n",

So we know that E is a function of a2, and we know that a2 is a function of z2, and z2 is a function of w2. Therefore, we can take the derivative of E with respect to a2, and take the derivative of a2 with respect to z2, and take the derivative of z2 with respect to w2. Then the derivative of the error with respect to w2 would be simply the product of these individual derivatives, like so. The derivative of E with respect to a2 is -(T - a2) and the derivative of a2 with respect to z2 is a2(1- a2) and the derivative of z2 with respect to w2 is just the input a1. Therefore, w2 is updated as per the following equation. I'm assuming that you a're familiar with differentiation, so I am going to skip showing you how to find the derivatives, but below the video you will find a document that I prepared showing you in details how to find each of the derivatives shown here. Updating b2 is exactly the same. The only difference is the derivative of z2 with respect to b2 is 1 and not the input a1. Similarly, we use this expression to update w1, but the error is not explicitly related to w1. So we again use the chain rule to establish the derivative of the error with respect to w1. We know that E is a function of a2, and we know that a2 is a function of z2 and z2 is a function of a1, and a1 is a function of z1, and z1 is a function of w1. Therefore, we can take the derivative of E with respect to a2, and take the derivative of a2 with respect to z2, and take the derivative of z2 with respect to a1, and take the derivative of a1 with respect to z1, and then finally take the derivative of z1 with respect to w1. Then the derivative of the error with respect to w1 would simply be the product of these individual derivatives, like so. The derivative of E with respect to a2 is -(T - a2). The derivative of a2 with respect to z2 is a2(1 - a2), and the derivative of z2 with respect to a1 is w2, and the derivative of a1 with respect to z1 is a1(1 - a1), and the derivative of z1 with respect to w1 is the input x1. Therefore, w1 is updated as per the following equation. Using the same approach we figure out the expression to update b1.\r\n",

This is the predicted value by the network for an input of 0.1. Now let's assume that the ground truth is 0.25. We first compute the error between the ground truth and the predicted value. Next, we will start updating the weights and biases for either a predefined number of iterations or epochs, like 1,000 for example, or until the error is within a predefined threshold of 0.001 for example.

        ">In this video, we will discuss a problem with the sigmoid activation function that prevented neural networks from booming sooner. This problem is the vanishing gradient problem. Recall from the previous video, with a very simple network of two neurons only, the derivatives of the error with respect to the weights were as follows. See how small the gradients are, but more importantly, how small the gradient of the error with respect to w1. \r\n",

        ">Well it turns out that because we are using the sigmoid function as the activation function, then all the intermediate values in the network are between 0 and 1. So when we do backpropagation, we keep multiplying factors that are less than 1 by each other, and so their gradients tend to get smaller and smaller as we keep on moving backward in the network. This means that the neurons in the earlier layers learn very slowly as compared to the neurons in the later layers in the network. The earlier layers in the network are the slowest to train. The result is a training process that takes too long and a prediction accuracy that is compromised. Accordingly, this is the reason why we do not use the sigmoid function or similar functions as activation functions, since they are prone to the vanishing gradient problem. Therefore, in the next video we will learn about other activation functions that became so popular and are now the activation functions that get used almost all the time in the hidden layers, since they help in overcoming the vanishing gradient problem.\r\n",

        ">As we discussed earlier, activation functions play a major role in the learning process of a neural network. So far, we have used only the sigmoid function as the activation function in our networks, but we saw how the sigmoid function has its shortcomings since it can lead to the vanishing gradient problem for the earlier layers. In this video, we will discuss other activation functions; ones that are more efficient to use and are more applicable to deep learning applications. There are seven types of activation functions that you can use when building a neural network. There is the binary step function, the linear or identity function, there is our old friend the sigmoid or logistic function, there is the hyperbolic tangent, or tanh, function, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function, the leaky ReLU function, and the softmax function. In this video, we will discuss the popular ones, which are the sigmoid, the hyperbolic tangent, ReLU, and the softmax functions.\r\n",

        ">This is the sigmoid function. At z = 0, a is equal to 0.5 and when z is a very large positive number, a is close to 1, and when z is a very large negative number, a is close to zero. Sigmoid functions used to be widely used as activation functions in the hidden layers of a neural network. However, as you can see, the function is pretty flat beyond the +3 and -3 region. This means that once the function falls in that region, the gradients become very small. This results in the vanishing gradient problem that we discussed, and as the gradients approach 0, the network doesn't really learn. Another problem with the sigmoid function is that the values only range from 0 to 1. This means that the sigmoid function is not symmetric around the origin. The values received are all positive. Well, not all the times would we desire that values going to the next neuron be all of the same sign. This can be addressed by scaling the sigmoid function, and this brings us to the next activation function: the hyperbolic tangent function. \r\n",

        ">This is the hyperbolic tangent, or tanh, function. It is very similar to the sigmoid function. It is actually just a scaled version of the sigmoid function, but unlike the sigmoid function, it's symmetric over the origin. It ranges from -1 to +1. However, although it overcomes the lack of symmetry of the sigmoid function, it also leads to the vanishing gradient problem in very deep neural networks.\r\n",

        ">The rectified linear unit, or ReLU, function is the most widely used activation function when designing networks today. In addition to it being nonlinear, the main advantage of using the ReLU, function over the other activation functions is that it does not activate all the neurons at the same time. According to the plot here, if the input is negative it will be converted to 0, and the neuron does not get activated. This means that at a time, only a few neurons are activated, making the network sparse and very efficient. Also, the ReLU function was one of the main advancements in the field of deep learning that led to overcoming the vanishing gradient problem. \r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">One last activation function that we will discuss here is the softmax function. The softmax function is also a type of a sigmoid function, but it is handy when we are trying to handle classification problems. The softmax function is ideally used in the output layer of the classifier where we are actually trying to get the probabilities to define the class of each input. So, if a network with 3 neurons in the output layer outputs [1.6, 0.55, 0.98] then with a softmax activation function, the outputs get converted to [0.51, 0.18, 0.31]. This way, it is easier for us to classify a given data point and determine to which category it belongs.\r\n",

        ">In conclusion, the sigmoid and the tanh functions are avoided in many applications nowadays since they can lead to the vanishing gradient problem. The ReLU function is the function that's widely used nowadays, and it's important to note that it is only used in the hidden layers. Finally, when building a model, you can begin with using the ReLU function and then you can switch to other activation functions if the ReLU function does not yield a good performance. And this concludes this video on activation functions. I'll see you in the next video.\r\n",

        ">Before we can start building deep learning networks, we will spend some time learning about the different deep learning libraries and frameworks that are out there. In this video, I will briefly cover the libraries that we'll be teaching in this specialization. The most popular library is in descending order are TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. There is also Theano, a library developed by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, and was the major library for deep learning development even before TensorFlow and PyTorch. However, the founders can't afford to continuously support it and maintain it, and therefore, the library lost its popularity. Because of that, in this specialization, we will focus on the three other popular libraries.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">Among the three libraries. TensorFlow is the most popular one. It is the library that is mostly used in production of deep learning models. It has a very large community. Just a quick look at the number of forks on the library's Github repository as well as the number of commits and pull requests should suffice in giving you an idea of how popular the library is. Tensorflow was developed by Google and released to the public in 2015, and is still being actively used at Google for both research and production needs. PyTorch on the other hand, is the cousin of the Torch framework, which is in Lua, and supports machine learning algorithms running on GPUs in particular. However being derived from the Torch framework, PyTorch isn't just a set of wrappers to support a popular language like Python. Tt was actually rewritten and tailored to be fast and feel native. PyTorch was released in 2016 and has gained immense interest lately and is becoming the preferred language over TensorFlow, especially in academic research settings and applications of deep learning requiring optimizing custom expressions. PyTorch is supported and being actively used at Facebook. However, despite their popularity, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are not easy to use, and have a steep learning curve. So for people who are just starting to learn deep learning, there is no better library to use other than the Keras library. Keras is a high level API for building deep learning models. It has gained favor for its ease of use and syntactic simplicity facilitating fast development. As you'll see in the next couple of videos, building a very complex deep learning network can be achieved with Keras with only few lines of code. Keras normally runs on top of a low-level library such as TensorFlow. This means that to be able to use the Kares library, you will have to install TensorFlow first, and when you import Keras, it will be explicitly displayed what backend was used to install the Keras library. Keras is also supported by Google. I won't go into more details about the different libraries, but the take home message here is if you're interested in building something quickly go with the Keras library; you won't be disappointed. However, if you want to have more control over the different nodes and layers in the network, and want to watch closely what happens with the network over time, then PyTorch or TensorFlow would be the right library. It will really boil down to your personal preference. With that, in the next videos, we will start learning how to use the Keras library to build models for regression and classification problems.\r\n",

Here is a data set of the compressive strength of different samples of concrete based on the volumes of the different materials that were used to make them.

Such a concrete mix which is 28 days old has a compressive strength of 79.99 MPa. The data is in a pandas dataframe and named concrete_data. So let's say we would like to use the Keras library to quickly build a deep neural network to model this dataset, and so we can automatically determine the compressive strength of a given concrete sample based on its ingredients.\r\n",

Note that usually you would go with a much larger number of neurons in each hidden layer like 50 or even 100, but we're just using a small network for simplicity. Notice how all the nodes in one layer are connected to all the other nodes in the next layer. Such a network is called a dense network.\r\n",

We will also name them predictors and target. \r\n",

        ">Now prepare to see the magic of Keras and how building such a network and training it and using it to predict new samples can be achieved with only few lines of code. The first thing you will need to do is import Keras and the Sequential model from \"keras.models\". Because our network consists of a linear stack of layers, then the Sequential model is what you would want to use. This is the case most of the time unless you are building something out of the ordinary. There are two models in the Keras library. One of them is the Sequential model and the other one is the model class used with the functional API. So to create your model, you simply call the Sequential constructor. Now building your layers is pretty straightforward as well. For that, we would need to import the \"Dense\" type of layers from \"keras.layers\". Then we use the add method to add each dense layer. We specify the number of neurons in each layer and the activation function that we want to use. As per our discussion in the video on activation functions, ReLU is one of the recommended activation functions for hidden layers, so we will use that. And for the first hidden layer we need to pass in the \"input_shape\" parameter, which is the number of columns or predictors in our dataset. Then we repeat the same thing for the other hidden layer, of course without the input_shape parameter, and we create our output layer with one node. Now for training, we need to define an optimizer and the error metric. In the previous module, we used gradient descent as our minimization or optimization algorithm, and the mean squared error as our loss measure between the predicted value and the ground truth. So we will stick with that and use the mean squared error as our loss measure. As for the minimization algorithm, there are actually other more efficient algorithms than the gradient descent for deep learning applications. One of them is \"adam\". One of the main advantages of the \"adam\" optimizer is that you don't need to specify the learning rate that we saw in the gradient descent video. So this saves us the task of optimizing the learning rate for our model. Then we use the fit method to train our model. Once training is complete, we can start making predictions using the predict method.\r\n",

So, here is a dataset that we are calling \"car_data\". I already cleaned the data, as you can see, where I used one-hot encoding to transform each category of price, maintenance, and how many people the car can accommodate, into separate columns. So the price of the car can be either high, medium, or low. Similarly, the cost of maintaining the car can also be high, medium, or low, and the car can either fit two people or more. If you take the first car in the dataset, it is considered an expensive car, has high maintenance cost, and can fit only two people. The decision is 0, meaning that buying this car would be a bad choice.

We easily achieve that using the \"to_categorical\" function from the Keras utilities package. In other words, our model instead of having just one neuron in the output layer, it would have four neurons, since our target variable consists of four categories. \r\n",

The additional import statement here is the \"to_categorical\" function in order to transform our target column into an array of binary numbers for classification. Then, we proceed to constructing our layers. We use the add method to create two hidden layers, each with five neurons and the neurons are activated using the ReLU activation function. Notice how here we also specify the softmax function as the activation function for the output layer, so that the sum of the predicted values from all the neurons in the output layer sum nicely to 1. Then in defining our compiler, here we will use the categorical cross-entropy as our loss measure instead of the mean squared error that we use for regression, and we will specify the evaluation metric to be \"accuracy\". \"accuracy\" is a built-in evaluation metric in Keras but you can actually define your own evaluation metric and pass it in the metrics parameter. Then we fit the model. Notice how this time we're specifying the number of epochs for training the model.

For each data point, the output is the probability that the decision of purchasing a given car belongs to one of the four classes. For each data point, the probabilities should sum to 1, and the higher the probability the more confident is the algorithm that a datapoint belongs to the respective class. So for the first data point or the first car in the test set, the decision would be 0 meaning not acceptable, since the first probability is the highest, with a value of 0.99 or close to 1, in this case. Similarly, for the second datapoint, the decision is also 0 or not acceptable, since the probability for this class is the highest, again with a value of 0.99 or almost 1. For the first three datapoints, the model is very confident that purchasing these cars is not acceptable. As for the last three datapoints, the decision would be 1 or acceptable, since the probabilities for the second class are higher than the rest of the classes.

        ">So far, we have mostly been dealing with not very deep, or shallow, neural networks. And the main reason is that they really do serve as the building block of deep neural networks and are easier to understand due to their simplicity. There isn't really a consensus on the definition of a shallow neural network but a neural network with one hidden layer is considered a shallow neural network whereas a network with many hidden layers and a large number of neurons in each layer is considered a deep neural network. Also, unlike a shallow neural network which takes only input as vectors, deep neural networks are able to take raw data such as images and text and automatically extract the necessary features to learn the data better. We will start learning about deep learning algorithms in the next videos. But if neural networks have been around for quite some time, how come only recently did they turn deep and start taking off resulting in a plethora of cool and exciting applications? \r\n",

        ">The sudden boom in the deep learning field can be attributed to three main factors. Number one, advancement in the field itself. We talked about this briefly in the activation functions video, where we mentioned that the ReLU activation function helped overcome the challenge of the vanishing gradient problem, and therefore, opened the door to the creation of very deep networks. Therefore, advancement in the field itself is one factor that helped deep learning take off. Another main reason is the availability of data. Deep neural networks work best when trained with large and large amounts of data, since neural networks learn the training data so well, then large amounts of data have to be used in order to avoid overfitting of the training data. Now that large amounts of data are readily available and easy to acquire like never before, deep learning algorithms are being tried and tested like never before. Especially that the other conventional machine learning algorithms, while they do improve with more data, but up to a certain point. After that, no significant improvement would be observed with more data. That is definitely not the case with deep learning. The more data you feed it the better it performs. Finally, and this goes hand-in-hand with point number 2, is computational power. With NVIDIA's super powerful GPUs, we are now able to train very deep neural networks on tremendous amount of data in a matter of hours as opposed to days or weeks, which is how long it used to take to train very deep neural networks. Therefore, users are able to experiment with different deep neural networks and test different prototypes in much shorter periods of time. These three factors are the main reasons behind the boom of deep learning. In the next video, we will start learning about deep learning algorithms. We will start with supervised deep learning algorithms, and in the next video, we will learn about convolutional neural networks.\r\n",

        "> Convolutional neural networks, which are supervised deep learning models have revolutionized the field of computer vision, especially object detection in images.Convolutional neural networks are very similar to the neural networks that we have seen so far in this course. They are made up of neurons, which need to have the weights and biases optimized. Each neuron combines the inputs that it receives by computing the dot product between each input and the corresponding weight before it fits the resulting total input into an activation function, ReLU most likely. So then, what is different with these networks and why are they called convolutional neural networks? Well convolutional neural networks, or CNNs for short, make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to incorporate certain properties into their architecture. These properties make the forward propagation step much more efficient and vastly reduces the amount of parameters in the network. Therefore, CNNs are best for solving problems related to image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision applications.\r\n",

        ">Convolutional layers are the major building blocks used in convolutional neural networks.A convolution is the simple application of a filter(kernel) to an input that results in an activation. Repeated application of the same filter to an input results in a map of activations called a feature map, indicating the locations and strength of a detected feature in an input, such as an image. So in the convolutional layer, we basically define filters(kernels) and we compute the convolution between the defined filters and each of the three images. If we take the red image for example, let's assume these are the pixel values. Now for a (2 x 2) filter with these values, let's create an empty matrix to save the results of the convolution process. We start by sliding(stride) the filter over the image and computing the dot product between the filter and the overlapping pixel values and storing the result in the empty matrix. We repeat this step moving our filter one cell, or one stride is the proper terminology, at a time, and we repeat this until we cover the entire image and fill the empty matrix. Here, I just showed one filter and only one of the three images. The same thing would be applied to the green and blue images and you can apply more than one filter. The more filters we use, the more we are able to preserve the spatial dimensions better. But one question you must be asking yourself at this point is, why would we need to use convolution? Why not flatten the input image into an (n x m) x 1 vector and use that as our input? Well, if we do that, we will end up with a massive number of parameters that will need to be optimized, and it will be super computationally expensive. Also, decreasing the number of parameters would definitely help in preventing the model from overfitting the training data. \r\n",

        ">The next layer in our convolutional neural network is the pooling layer. The pooling layer's main objective is to reduce the spatial dimensions of the data propagating through the network. There are two types of pooling that are widely used in convolutional neural networks. Max- pooling and average pooling. In max-pooling which is the most common of the two, for each section of the image we scan we keep the highest value, like so. Here our filter is moving two strides at a time. Similarly, with average pooling, we compute the average of each area we scan. In addition to reducing the dimension of the data, pooling, or max pooling in particular, provides spatial variance which enables the neural network to recognize objects in an image even if the object does not exactly resemble the original object. \r\n",

        ">Finally, in the fully connected layer, we flatten the output of the last convolutional layer and connect every node of the current layer with every other node of the next layer. This layer basically takes as input the output from the preceding layer, whether it is a convolutional layer, ReLU, or pooling layer, and outputs an n-dimensional vector, where n is the number of classes pertaining to the problem at hand. For example, if you are building a network to classify images of digits, the dimension n would be 10, since there are 10 digits. You will be covering convolutional neural networks in much more details in the other courses in this specialization, but this information is more than enough to give you a general understanding of convolutional neural networks. Now let's see how we can use the Keras library to build a convolutional neural network. \r\n",

        ">Here I will show you how you can use the Keras library to build a convolutional neural network. Training and testing of a convolutional neural network are the same as what we have seen so far. So to begin with, we use the sequential constructor to create our model. Then, we define our input to be the size of the input images. Assuming the input images are 128 by 128 color images, we define the input shape to be a tuple of (128, 128, 3). Next, we start adding layers to the network. We start with a convolutional layer, with 16 filters, each filter being of size 2x2 and slides through the image with a stride of magnitude 1 in the horizontal direction, and of magnitude 1 in the vertical direction. And the layer uses the ReLU activation function. Then, we add a pooling layer and we're using max-pooling here with a filter or pooling size of 2 and the filter slides through the image with a stride of magnitude 2. Next, we add another set of convolutional and pooling layers. The only difference here is we are using more filters in the convolutional layer, actually twice as many filters as the first convolutional layer. Finally, we flatten the output from these layers so that the data can proceed to the fully connected layers. We add another dense layer with 100 nodes and an output layer that has nodes equal to the number of classes in the problem at hand. And we use the softmax activation function in order to convert the outputs into probabilities.\r\n",

        ">In this video, we will learn about another supervised deep learning model, which is the recurrent neural network. So far, we have seen neural networks and deep learning models that see datapoints as independent instances. However, let's say you want to build a model that can analyze scenes in a movie. Well, you cannot assume that scenes in a movie are independent, and therefore, traditional deep learning models are not suitable for this application. Recurrent neural networks overcome this issue. Recurrent neural networks or (RNNs) for short, are networks with loops that don't just take a new input at a time, but also take in as input the output from the previous dat point that was fed into the network. Accordingly, this is how the architecture of a recurrent neural network would look like. Essentially, we can start with a normal neural network. At time t = 0, the network takes in input x0 and outputs a0. Then, at time t = 1, in addition to the input x1, the network also takes a0 as input, weighted with weight w0,1, and so on and so forth. As a result, recurrent neural networks are very good at modelling patterns and sequences of data, such as texts, genomes, handwriting, and stock markets. These algorithms take time and sequence into account, which means that they have a temporal dimension.\r\n",

        "> A very popular type of recurrent neural network is the long short-term memory model or the (LSTM) model for short. It has been successfully used for many applications including image generation, where a model trained on many images is used to generate new novel images. Another application is handwriting generation, which I described in the welcome video of this course. Also LSTM models have been successfully used to build algorithms that can automatically describe images as well as streams of videos. \r\n",

        "> In this video, we will switch to an unsupervised deep learning model which is the autoencoder. So what are autoencoders? Autoencoding is a data compression algorithm where the compression and the decompression functions are learned automatically from data. instead of being engineered by a human. Such autoencoders are built using neural networks. Autoencoders are data specific, which means that they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on. Therefore, an autoencoder trained on pictures of cars would do a rather poor job of compressing pictures of buildings, because the features it would learn would be vehicle or car specific. Some interesting applications of autoencoders are data denoising and dimensionality reduction for data visualization. \r\n",

        ">Here is the architecture of an autoencoder. It takes an image, for example, as an input and uses an encoder to find the optimal compressed representation of the input image. Then, using a decoder the original image is restored. So an autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network model. It uses backpropagation by setting the target variable to be the same as the input. In other words, it tries to learn an approximation of an identity function. Because of non-linear activation functions in neural networks, autoencoders can learn data projections that are more interesting than a principal component analysis PCA or other basic techniques, which can handle only linear transformations. \r\n",

Because RBMs learn the input in order to be able to regenerate it, then they can learn the distribution of the minority class in an imbalance dataset ,and then generate more data points of that class, transforming the imbalance dataset into a balanced data set. Similarly, RBMs can also be used to estimate missing values in different features of a data set. Another popular application of Restricted Boltzmann Machines is automatic feature extraction of especially unstructured data. \r\n",

We also briefly covered neurons and neural networks in the brain to appreciate how they inspire artificial neural networks, and then we learned how neural networks make predictions through the forward propagation process. In module 2, we learned how an artificial neural network learns through gradient descent and backpropagation. We also learned about the vanishing gradient problem, and which activation functions are best to overcome this problem. In module 3, we learnt about the Keras library and how to use it to build models for regression and classification problems. In module 4, we learned about supervised and unsupervised deep neural networks, and we used the Keras library to build a convolutional neural network."

        ">Hello, and welcome! In this video, we’ll be going through a brief overview of the structure and capabilities of the TensorFlow library. So let’s get started. TensorFlow is an open source library developed by the Google Brain Team. It’s an extremely versatile library, originally created for tasks that require heavy numerical computations. For this reason, TensorFlow was geared towards the problem of machine learning, and deep neural networks. Due to a C/C++ backend, TensorFlow is able to run faster than pure Python code. The last thing I’d like to mention is that a TensorFlow application uses a structure known as a data flow graph, which is very useful to first build and then execute it in a session. It is also a very common programming model for parallel computing. We’ll cover this in more detail shortly. \r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(917).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">TensorFlow offers several advantages for an application. For instance, it provides both a Python and a C++ API. It should be noted, though, that Python API is more complete and it’s generally easier to use. TensorFlow also has great compilation times in comparison to the alternative deep learning libraries. And it supports CPUs, GPUs, and even distributed processing in a cluster. It is a very important feature as you can train a neural network using CPU and multiple GPUs, which makes the models very efficient on large-scale systems.\r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(918).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">TensorFlow’s structure is based on the execution of a data flow graph. So, let’s take a closer look at this. A data flow graph, has two basic units. The nodes that represent a mathematical operation, and the edges which represent the multi-dimensional arrays, known as a tensors. So this high-level abstraction reveals how the data flows between operations. Please notice that using the data flow graph, we can easily visualize different parts of the graph, which is not an option while using other Python libraries such as Numpy or SciKit. The standard usage is to build a graph first and then execute it in a session. \r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(919).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">So, What is a Tensor? Well as we’ve already noted, the data that’s passed between the operations are Tensors. In effect, a Tensor is a multidimensional array. It can be zero dimensional, such as scalar values, one dimensional as a line or vector, or 2-dimensional, such as a Matrix, and so on. The Tensor structure helps us by giving us the freedom to shape the dataset the way we want. It’s also particularly helpful when dealing with images, due to the nature of how the information within images is encoded. Indeed, when you think about an image, it’s easy to understand that it has height and width, so it would make sense to represent the information contained in it with a two dimensional structure, such as a matrix, for example. But as you know, images have colors, and to add information about the colors, we need another dimension, and that’s when a 3-dimensional tensor becomes particularly helpful.\r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(948).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">Now, let’s take a look at a dataflow graph and see how tensors and operations build the graph. As mentioned before, in a dataflow graph, the nodes are called operations, which represent units of computation. The edges are tensors which represent the data consumed or produced by an operation. In this graph, Feature matrix is a placeholder. Placeholders can be seen as \"holes\" in your model -- \"holes\" through which you can pass the data from outside of the graph. Placeholders allow us to create our operations in the graph, without needing the data. When we want to execute the graph, we have to feed placeholders with our input data. This is why we need to initialize placeholders before using them. Let’s look at another operation which builds the variables for our program. In this graph, Weight Matrix is a variable. TensorFlow variables, are used to share and persist some values, that are manipulated by the program Please notice that when you define a place- holder or variable, TensorFlow adds an operation to your graph. In our graph, “Weight matrix” and “Feature matrix” should be multiplied using a multiplication operation. After that, Add operation is called, which adds the result of the previous operation with bias term. The output of each operation is a tensor. The resulting tensors of each operation crosses the next one until the end where it's possible to get the desired result. After adding all these operations in a graph, we can create a session to run the graph, and perform the computations. For a better understanding of TensorFlow graphs, I recommend that you run the labs from this module, which walk you through different elements of the data flow, in the TensorFlow library. \r\n",

        ">Hello and welcome! In this video we'll be talking about TensorFlow 2.x and Eager Execution. This course was originally created in the days of TensorFlow 1.x, but now has been updated for TensorFlow version 2.x, which includes a major update and some important new capabilities. One of the major changes within TensorFlow 2.x is that the Keras framework has become the official high level API for TensorFlow. Keras is a Deep Learning API written in Python and is known for its user-friendliness. It offers abstractions that make it easy to develop deep learning models. However, Keras does not have its own execution engine and is dependent on other frameworks like Theano or TensorFlow. With TensorFlow 2.x, TensorFlow has not only become the default execution engine for Keras, but they are also now more tightly integrated. What this means for TensorFlow users, especially Python developers, is that they can now develop models more easily using Keras interfaces, yet leverage the powerful capabilities of TensorFlow in the back-end. Another TensorFlow 2.x enhancement is performance optimizations, multi-GPU support, and improved APIs for better usability for GPU acceleration. Besides this, one very prominent change in TensorFlow 2.x is Eager Execution. In cases where Keras, which is a high level API, isn’t sufficient for your needs, you'll still need to use the TensorFlow low-level API. In such cases, Eager Execution mode is activated by default in TensorFlow 2.x, and, in fact, is the recommended way of using the TensorFlow low level API. Please keep in mind, however, that the low level TensorFlow API involves the use of linear algebra to express neural network layers.\r\n",

        ">So, what is Eager Execution mode? Well, let’s have a look at this code snippet. As you can see, we are initializing two tensors, A and B. Then we compute the tensor dot product and assign the result to C. But so far no computation has happened. C only represents an execution graph, which does not yet have a value. Only once executed within a TensorFlow session does a computation happen and a value is assigned to C. As such, this makes TensorFlow code very hard to debug as intermediate results are not accessible.\r\n",

With eager execution enabled, which by the way is the default in TensorFlow 2.x, code gets immediately executed, line by line, and intermediate results are instantly available. Eager Execution makes TensorFlow code look like ordinary Python code. And this is achieved without even needing to change your code when jumping between the two TensorFlow versions.

In the internet service and mobile phone industries, we can see various apps which are using Deep Learning for image/video classification and speech recognition, such as, Google Voice, Apple Siri, Microsoft Skype, and so on. In media, entertainment, and news, we can see applications such as video captioning, real-time translation and personalization, or recommendation systems such as Netflix.

To better understand Deep Learning, let’s first take a look at different deep neural networks and their applications, namely: • Convolutional Neural Networks (or CNNs) • Recurrent Neural Networks (or RNNs) • Restricted Boltzmann Machines (or RBMs) • Deep Belief Networks (or DBNs), and finally • Autoencoders.\r\n",

        ">**Convolutional Neural Network**  \r\n",
        "Let’s start with the Convolutional Neural Network, and see how it helps us to do a task, such as image classification. Assume that you have a dataset made up of a great many photos of cats and dogs, and you want to build a model that can recognize and differentiate them. This model is supposed to look at this particular sample set of images and learn from them, toward becoming trained. Later, given an unseen image of either a cat or a dog, we should be able to use this trained model to recognize the image as being one or the other. Traditionally, your first step in building such a model would be “feature extraction.” That is, to choose the best features from your images, and then use those features in a classification algorithm, such as a shallow Neural Network. Ideally, the result would be a model that, upon analyzing a new image, could accurately distinguish the animal in that photo as being either a “cat” or a “dog.” There are countless features that could be extracted from the image, such as color, object edges, pixel location, and so on. Of course, the better that you can define the feature sets, the more accurate and efficient your image-classification will be. In fact, in the last two decades, there has been a lot of scientific research in the field of image processing, that is devoted to helping data scientists find the best feature sets from images, for the purposes of classification. However, as you can imagine, the process of selecting and using the best features is tremendously time-consuming and is often ineffective. Furthermore, extending the features to other types of images becomes an even greater challenge. Indeed, it’s easy to see how difficult it would be to apply the features we’ve used to discriminate cats and dogs, to other discrimination tasks, such as recognizing hand-written digits, for example. Therefore, the importance of feature selection can’t be overstated. Enter “convolutional neural networks”. Suddenly, without having to find or select features, this network automatically and effectively finds the best features for you. So instead of you choosing what image features to use in classifying dogs vs. cats, Convolutional Neural Networks can automatically find those features and classify the images for you. So, we can say that a Convolutional Neural Network - or CNN for short - is a deep learning approach that learns directly from samples in a way that is much more effective than traditional Neural networks. \r\n",

        "Now, let’s look at Recurrent Neural networks and the types of situations in which they can be used, to solve a problem. A Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN for short, is a type of deep learning approach, that tries to solve the problem of modeling sequential data. Whenever the points in a dataset are dependent on the previous points, the data is said to be sequential. For example, a stock market price is a sequential type of data because the price of any given stock in tomorrow’s market, to a great extent, depends on its price today. As such, predicting the stock price tomorrow, is something that RNNs can be used for. We simply need to feed the network with the sequential data, it then maintains the context of the data and thus, learns the patterns within the data.\r\n",

        ">We can also use RNNs for sentiment analysis. Let’s say for example, you’re scrolling through your product catalogue on a social network site and you see many comments related to a particular product of yours. Rather than reading through dozens and dozens of comments yourself and having to manually calculate if they were mostly positive, you can let an RNN do that for you. Indeed, an RNN can examine the sentiment of keywords in those reviews. Please remember, though, that the sequence of the words or sentences, as well as the context in which they are used, is very important as well. By feeding a sentence into an RNN, it takes all of this into account and determines if it the sentiment within it those product reviews are positive or negative. RNNs can also be used to predict the next word in a sentence. I’m sure we’ve all seen how our mobile phone suggests words when we’re typing an email or a text. This is a type of language modeling within RNN, where the model has learned from a big textual corpus, and now can predict the next word in the sentence. As you can see, thinking in a sequential way, the word being suggested is very dependent on the previously typed words and the context of that message. \r\n",

This task is not based on a word-by-word translation and applying grammar rules. Instead, it is a probability model that has been trained on lots of data where the exact same text is translated into another language. \r\n",

Restricted Boltzman Machines, or RBMs, are used to find the patterns in data in an unsupervised manner. They are shallow neural nets that learn to reconstruct data by themselves. They are very important models, because they can automatically extract meaningful features from a given input, without the need to label them.\r\n",

Which problem? The back-propagation problem, that can often cause “local minima” or “vanishing gradients” issues in the learning process. A DBN is built to solve this by the stacking of multiple RBMs. So, what are the applications of DBNs? DBNs are generally used for classification -- same as traditional MLPs. So, one of the most important applications of DBNs is image recognition. The important part to remember, here, is that a DBN is a very accurate discriminative classifier. As such, we don’t need a big set of labeled data to train a Deep Belief Network; in fact, a small set works fine because feature extraction is unsupervised by a stack of RBMs. \r\n",

        "Now, let’s look at Autoencoders. Much like RBMs, Autoencoders were invented to address the issue of extracting desirable features. And again, much like RBMs, Autoencoders try to recreate a given input, but do so with a slightly different network architecture and learning method. Autoencoders take a set of unlabeled inputs, encodes them into short codes, and then uses those to reconstruct the original image, while extracting the most valuable information from the data. \r\n",

        ">What are the applications of Autoencoders? Well, Autoencoders are employed in some of the largest deep learning applications, especially for unsupervised tasks. As the encoder part of the network, Autoencoders compress data from the input layer into a short code -- a method that can be used for “dimensionality reduction” tasks. Also, in stacking multiple Autoencoder layers, the network learns multiple levels of representation at different levels of abstraction. For example, to detect a face in an image, the network encodes the primitive features, like the edges of a face. Then, the first layer's output goes to the second Autoencoder, to encode the less local features, like the nose, and so on. Therefore, it can be used for Feature Extraction and image recognition. By now, you should have a good sense of deep neural networks. \r\n",

        "Defining a linear regression in simple terms, is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variables. In a simple linear regression there are two variables, the dependent variable, which can be seen as the \"state\" or \"final goal\" that we study and try to predict, and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, which can be seen as the \"causes\" of the \"states\". \n",

        ">Convolutional neural networks or CNNs have gained a lot of attention in the machine learning community over the last few years. This is due to the wide range of applications where CNNs excel, such as object detection and speech recognition. In a later part of this video, we'll examine the object recognition problem, which is a key consideration when using CNNs. You'll also get an idea of how a CNN structure allows it to extract the elements from an image. For example, you'll see how a CNN learns to pick out a person or a dog or even chairs from an image, even if the chairs are only partially visible. Indeed, this is not an easy task for computers and it took years of dedicated research to achieve this. \r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(950).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">The original goal of the CNN was to form the best possible representation of our visual world in order to support recognition tasks. The CNN solution needed to have two key features to make it viable. First, It needed to be able to detect the objects in the image and place them into the appropriate category. Second, it also needed to be robust against differences in pose, scale, illumination, confirmation and clutter. The importance of this second feature simply cannot be overstated, since this was historically a huge limitation of hand-coded algorithms.\r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(951).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">Interestingly enough, the solution to the object recognition issue was inspired by examining the way our own visual cortex operates. In short, the CNN starts with an input image. It then extracts a few primitive features and combines those features to form certain parts of the object. Finally, it pulls together all of the various parts to form the object itself. In essence, it is a hierarchical way of seeing objects. That is, in the first layer, very simple features are detected. Then these are combined to shape more complicated features in the second layer and so on to detect things like a cat or a dog or any other object we're needing to detect. The convolutional neural network was developed from this sequence of steps.\r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(952).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">Let's consider the building in the lower right-hand corner of this image. How can a trained CNN learn and recognize that it's an image of a building, rather than some of the other elements that are situated in the photograph, such as a person or even those clouds in the sky?\r\n",
        "![](https://github.com/harsha8745/IBM-WATSON/blob/Images/Screenshot%20(953).png?raw=true)\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        ">Well, in the training phase, CNNs would receive many building images as input. Then CNNs will automatically find that the best primitive features for a building would be things like horizontal and vertical lines. Much like the neurons firing in a person's visual cortex, the first layer in a CNN reacts when it receives an image that has horizontal or vertical lines. Once these simpler features such as lines are combined, CNNs learn to form higher abstract components, like the windows of the building and the building's external shape. It can then use these basic parts to form the complete object and learn how the entire building essentially looks like. Later, if it sees an image of a building that it hasn't seen before, CNNs can make a decision if the new input image is of a building based on the persistence of the various features it has stored. It is the same process for learning and detecting other objects, such as faces, animals, cars, and so on. So as you can see, the CNN is a set of layers with each of them being responsible to detect a set of feature sets, and these features are going to be more abstract as it goes further into examining the next layer. So at this point, you should have a basic understanding of the principles behind a convolutional neural network, and how CNNs might be used in an application.\r\n",

        ">Hello, and welcome! In this video, we’ll explain how CNN can solve an image classification problem such as digit recognition. First, let’s see why traditional shallow neural networks do not work as well as CNN. As mentioned before, one of the important steps in the modeling for classification with Shallow Neural Networks, is the feature extraction step. These chosen features could simply be the color, object edges, pixel location, or countless other features that could be extracted from the images. Of course, the better and more effective the feature sets you find, the more accurate and efficient the image classification you can obtain. However, as you can imagine, the process of selecting the best features is tremendously time-consuming, and is often ineffective. Also, extending the features to other types of images becomes an even greater problem.\r\n",

Second, training the deep learning model. And third, inference and deployment of the model. In the first part, we have to convert the images to a readable and proper format for our network. Then, an untrained network is fed with a big dataset of the images in the Training phase, so as to allow the network to learn. That is, we build a CNN, and train it with many hand-written images in the training set. Finally, we use the trained model in the Inference phase, which classifies a new image by inferring its similarity to the trained model.

The convolutional layer applies a convolution operation to the input, and passes the result to the next layer. The pooling layer combines the outputs of a cluster of neurons in the previous layer into a single neuron in the next layer.

For example, it's edges. Assume that you have an image and you want to find the edges from the photo so that you can define a filter which is also called a kernel. Now, if you slide the filter over the image and apply the dot product of the filter to the image pixels, the result would be a new image with all of the edges. That is, applying the filter to the left image will result in the right features that are typically useful for the initial layers of a CNN. In fact, the output is one of the very first primitive feature sets in the hierarchy of features, it is one of the key concepts behind CNNs. Now, the question is, what really happens mathematically when we apply a filter or kernel on an image?\r\n",

The convolution operation can be seen as a mathematical function. Imagine that we have a simple black and white image as you see here. We can convert the image to a matrix of pixels with binary values where one means a white pixel and zero represents a black pixel. Please keep in mind however, that the most common usage is a value between 0 and 255 for a gray scale image or a three-channel image for a color image. But for now and for the sake of simplicity, let's use zero and one as our values. In this step, we define a filter. It can be any type of filter even a random filter, but let's use the Edge Detector filter for now. Now, let's slide it over the image and then calculate the convolved value for the first slide. Taking the values negative one and one on two adjacent pixels and zero everywhere else for the filter, results in the following image. Now, let's slide the kernel again. It will calculate the second element of our convolved image. We repeat this process to complete the convolved matrix. So in essence, the convolution function is a simple matrix multiplication and in this instance, the result shows us the edges of the image\r\n",

Now you can understand that leveraging different kernels allows us to find different patterns in an image such as edges, curves, and so on. The output of the convolution process is called a feature map. At this point, you might be asking yourself, how do I choose or initialize the proper kernels? Well, typically you initialize the kernels with random values and during the training phase, the values will be updated with optimum values in such a way that the digit is recognized.\r\n",

        ">This is the first layer of convolutional deep learning. We can interpret this layer to traditional neural network terminology. The input image can be considered as a matrix that we feed into the neural network through input nodes. For example in this case, the input layer of the network has 28 by 28 nodes. The output of the coevolution process are eight of 28 by 28 neurons. We can assume those as hidden nodes. So what are the weights between the input and hidden nodes? Yes, the eight kernels which are five by five. Now we need to make a decision as to whether each hidden neuron should be fired or not. \r\n",

ReLu is a non-linear activation function which is used to increase the non-linear properties of the decision function. So how can we apply it on a convolution layer? Well, we just go through all outputs of the convolution layer, convolved1, and wherever a negative number occurs we swap it out for a zero. This is called the ReLu activation function.\r\n",

        ">Now, we have gone one step further. In this step, we have to downsample the output images from the ReLu function to reduce the dimensionality of the activate neurons. We use another layer which is called max pooling. Max pooling is an operation that finds the maximum values and simplifies the inputs. In other words, it reduces the number of parameters within the model. In a sense, it turns the low-level data into higher level information. For example, we can select a Window of size of two by two and then select the maximum value for this matrix. That is, if the image is a two-by-two matrix, it would result in one output pixel. Also in this step, we can define strides. A stride dictates the sliding behavior of the max pooling. For example, if we select stride equals 2, the Window will move two pixels every time. Thus, not overlapping. Now we should have our output matrices but with lower dimensions. For example, 14 by 14. \r\n",

That is, all eight matrices in our case and convert them into a vector. First, each previous layer matrix will be converted to a one-dimensional vector. Then it will be fully connected to the next hidden layer which usually has a low number of hidden units. We call it fully connected because each node from the previous layer is connected to all the nodes of this layer. It is connected through a weight matrix. We can use ReLu activation again here. Finally, we use softmax to find the class of each digit. Softmax is an activation function that is normally used in classification problems. It generates the probabilities for the output. For example, our model will not be a 100 percent sure that what digit is the number 3. Instead, the answer will be a distribution of probabilities where if the model is right, the three will be assigned the larger probability. That is, softmax can output a multi-class categorical probability distribution. \r\n",

For example, here we see more than one convolutional layer followed by a few fully connected layers. Also, note the effect of each single conv, ReLu, and max pool operations pass through the image. It reduces height and width of the individual image and then it increases the depth of the images. For example, the output of the first convolutional layer is an image of Depth 8 and the output of the second layer is an image of Depth 32. This is very important because using multiple layers, CNN will be able to break down the complex patterns into a series of simpler patterns.\r\n",

Each neuron in a layer receives some input, processes it, and optionally follows it with a non-linear output using an activation function. So what is the network going to learn through the training process? It learns the connection between the layers. These are the learnable weights and biases matrices. In fact, the whole network as about a series of dot products between the weight matrices and the input matrix. This means we must first initialize the weights of the network randomly, then we will keep feeding the network with a big data set of images, we then check the output of the network and depending on how far the output is from the expected one, we change or update the weights. We keep repeating this process until it reaches a high accuracy of prediction. Of course this is a very high level picture of the whole training process.\r\n",

There could be many units of data or many time steps, so this becomes computationally expensive, one compromise is to only store a portion of the recent states in a time window. Another issue is that recurrent neural networks are extremely sensitive to changes in their parameters, as a result gradient descent optimizers may struggle to train the net. Also, the net may suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradient drops to nearly zero and training slows to a halt. Finally, it may also suffer from the exploding gradient, where the gradient grows exponentially off to infinity, in either case the model's capacity to learn will be diminished. By now, you should have a good understanding of the main ideas behind the recurrent neural network model.\r\n",

The.Recurrent Neural Network, is a great tool for modeling sequential data, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed in order to use the model on a large scale. For example, recurrent nets are needed to keep track of states, which is computationally expensive. Also, there are issues with training, like the vanishing gradient and the exploding gradient. As a result, the RNN, or to be precise, the Vanilla RNN cannot learn long sequences very well. A popular method to solve these problems is a specific type of RNN, which is called the Long Short- Term Memory or LSTM for short. LSTM maintains a strong gradient over many time steps. This means you can train an LSTM with relatively long sequences.\r\n",

The write, read, and forget gates define the flow of data inside the LSTM. The write gate is responsible for writing data into the memory cell. The read gate reads data from the memory cell and sends that data back to the recurrent network, and the forget gate, maintains or deletes data from the information cell, or in other words determines how much old information to forget. In fact, these gates are the operations in the LSTM that executes some function on a linear combination of the inputs to the network, the network's previous hidden state, and previous output. I don't want you to dive into the details of how these gates interact with each other, but what is important here is that by manipulating these gates, a recurrent network is able to remember what it needs in a sequence and simply forget what is no longer useful. Now, let's look at the data flow in LSTM recurrent networks. \r\n",

The LSTM then sends its output and hidden state to the net in the next time step, and the process continues for the next time steps. So as you can see, the LSTM unit keeps two pieces of information as it propagates through time. First a hidden state, which is in fact the memory the LSTM accumulates using its gates through time, and second, the previous time step output. \r\n",

So does this also apply to LSTMs? What if we want to have an RNN with stacked LSTM. For example, a two layer LSTM. In this case, the output of the first layer will feed as the input to the second layer. Then, the second LSTM blends it with its own internal state to produce an output. Stacking an LSTM allows for greater model complexity. So the second LSTM can create a more complex feature representation of the current input. That is, stacking LSTM hidden layers makes the model deeper, and most probably leads to more accurate results.\r\n",

We also determine how much new information called X, to incorporate through the input gate and it's weights. We also calculate the new cell state based on the current and the previous internal state so the network has to learn is corresponding weights and biases. Finally, we determine how much of our cell state we want to output an output gate. Basically, the network is learning the weights and biases used in each gate for each layer.

Language Modeling is a gateway into many exciting deep learning applications like Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, and Image Captioning.

Clearly, there are many options for what word could be used as the next one in the string. But a trained model might predict with an 80 percent probability of being correct that the word ''example'' is most likely to follow. This boils down to a sequential data analysis problem. The sequence of words forms the context and the most recent word is the input data. Using these two pieces of information, you need to output both a predicted word and a new context that contains the input word\r\n",

A new word would be predicted and these steps are repeated until the sentence is complete. \r\n",

For training such a network, we have to pass each word of the sentence to the network and let the network generate an output. For example, after passing the words, \"This'' and ''Is\", if we pass the word, \"an\" in the third time step, we expect the network to generate the word ''example'' as output. But notice that we cannot easily pass a word to the network. We have to convert it into a vector of numbers somehow. We can use Word Embedding for this purpose. Let's quickly examine what happens in Word Embedding. \r\n",

The vector is typically large, for example 200 length. You can see what that might look like with the word ''example'' here. You think of Word Embedding as a type of encoding for text to numbers. Now, the question is how do we find the proper values for these vectors? In our RNN model, the vectors also known as the matrix for the vocabulary are initialized randomly for all the words that we are going to use for training. Then during the recurrent network's training, the vector values are updated based on the context into which the word is being inserted. So words that are used in similar contexts end up with similar positions in the vector space. This can be visualized by utilizing a dimensionality reduction algorithm\r\n",

After training the RNN, if we visualize the words based on their embedding vectors, the words are grouped together, either because they're synonyms or they're used in similar places within a sentence. For example, the words ''zero'' and ''none'' are close semantically, so it's natural for them to be placed close together. While Italy and Germany aren't synonyms, they can be interchanged in several sentences without distorting the grammar.\r\n",

        ">Now let's look back at the RNN that we have been using. Imagine that the input data is a batch with only one sequence of words. Think of it as a batch that includes one sentence only, one that includes 20 words. Assume that the vocabulary size of the words is 10,000 words and the length of each embedding vector is 200. We have to look up those 20 words in the randomly initialized embedding matrix and then feed them into the first LSTM unit. Please notice that only one word in each time step is fed into the network and one word would be the output. But during 20 time steps, the output would be 20 words. In our network, we have two LSTM units with arbitrary hidden sizes of 256 and 128. So the output of the second LSTM unit would be a matrix of size 20 by 128. Now, we need a soft max layer to calculate the probability of the output words. It squashes that 128 dimensional vector of real values to a 10,000 dimensional vector, which is a vocabulary size. This means that the output of the network at each time step as a probability vector of length 10,000. So the output word is the one with maximum probability value in the vector. Now, we can compare the sequence of 20 output words with the ground truth words. Finally, calculate the discrepancy as a quantitative value, so-called loss value and back propagate the errors into the network\r\n",

        ">And of course we will not train the model using only one sequence. We will use a batch of sequences to train it and calculate the error. So instead of feeding one sequence, we can feed the network in many iterations, perhaps even a batch of 60 sentences for example. Now, the key question to be asked is, what does the network learn when the error is propagated back in each iteration? Well, as previously noted, the weights keep updating based on the error of the network in training. First, the embedding matrix will be updated in each iteration. Second, there are a bunch of weight matrices related to the gates in the LSTM units which will be changed. Finally, the weights related to the soft-max layer, which somehow plays the decoding role for the encoded words in the embedding layer. By now you should have a good understanding of how to use LSTM for language modeling. \r\n",

Imagine that we have access to a matrix of the viewer ratings of a certain number of movies on Netflix, where each row corresponds to a movie and each column corresponds to a user's rating. For the sake of simplicity, let's say we're only examining eight users and their ratings of seven movies. The value in each cell shows the score that the user has given to the movie after watching it and is based on a rating scale of one to five. Also, imagine that we have a type of neural network that has only two layers, the input layer and the hidden layer. Let's also assume that this network has learned in such a way that it can reconstruct the input vectors. For example, when you feed the first user vector into the network, it goes through the network and finally fires up some units in the hidden layer. Then the values of the hidden layer will be fed back into the network and a vector which is almost the same as the input vector is reconstructed as output. We can think of it as making guesses about the input data. You feed the second user's ratings, which are not very different from the first user and thus the same hidden units will be turned on and the network output would be the same as the first reconstructed vector. We can repeat it for the third user and for user number 4. Now, let's feed a user that has a completely different idea about these movies. As you can see, this particular user was not a fan of the first movie. When we feed the respective rating values into the network, different hidden units get turned on and a different vector is reconstructed which is almost the same as user number five's preferences. It is the same for user number 6, and the process can be repeated for the other users. Now, let's look at user number 8. He hasn't watched movie 6, but does have some preferences that are almost the same as users 5 and 6, right? Let's feed this vector into our network. It'll fire up the same hidden units as users 5 and 6, and feeding back these values will reconstruct a new vector. Look at the expected value for movie 6 in the reconstructed vector. Using this value is not hard to imagine that user number 8 might be interested in this movie even though he hasn't watched it yet. Maybe we could even recommended to him, yes. In fact, it is a way of solving collaborative filtering, which is a type of recommender system engine and the network that can make such a model is called a restricted Boltzmann machine.\r\n",

Then feeding an input image, the values that appear in the hidden layer can be considered as features learned automatically from the input data.

Let's say that we provide an image as input to an RBM. The pixels are processed by the input layer, which is also known as the visible layer. RBMs learn patterns and extract important features in data by reconstructing the input. So the learning earning process consists of several forward and backward passes where the RBM tries to reconstruct the input data. The weights of the neural net are adjusted in such a way that the RBM can find the relationships among input features and then determines which features irrelevant. After training is complete, the net is able to reconstruct the input based on what it learned. The reconstructed image here is only a representation of what happens. What's important to take from this example though, is that the RBM can automatically extract meaningful features from a given input in the training process? In fact, a trained RBM can reveal which features are the most important ones when detecting patterns. It can also represent each image with some hidden values also referred to as latent values.\r\n",

In the forward pass, the input image is converted to binary values and then the vector input is fed into the network where its values are multiplied by weights and an overall bias in each hidden unit. Then the result goes to an activation function such as the sigmoid function which represents the probability of turning each individual hidden unit on or in other words, the probability of the node activation. Then a sample is drawn from this probability distribution, and defines which neurons may or may not activate. This means it makes stochastic decisions about whether or not to transmit that hidden data. The intuition behind the sampling is that there are some random hidden variables and by sampling from the hidden layer, you can reproduce sample variance encountered during training. So as you can see the forward pass translates the inputs into a set of binary values that get represented in the hidden layer. \r\n",

During this step, the data that is passed backwards is also combined with the same weights and overall bias that were used in the forward pass. So once the information gets to the visible layer, it is in the shape of the probability distribution of the input values given the hidden values. And sampling the distribution, the input is reconstructed. So as you can see the backward pass is about making guesses about the probability distribution of the original input. \r\n",

Another advantage is that during the learning process the RBM extracts features from the input data decides, which features are relevant and how to best combine them to form patterns.

        ">Let me talk more about Dimension Reduction. High-dimensional data is a significant problem for machine learning tasks. In fact, data scientists commonly refer to it as the “CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY”. Many common problems that we want to target have a large number of dimensions. Even that 256 x 256 pixel image that we saw earlier, would have over 65 thousand dimensions; or in other words, one dimension for each pixel. A high-resolution image from a smart phone would be even larger. According to a study, the time to fit a model is, at best, the function you see here, which is a function of the number of points, dimensionality, and parameters. So, as we increase the dimensionality, our time to fit our model will increase exponentially. \r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">So, what happens when we increase or reduce the dimension of data? Well, if we have a huge number of dimensions, our data will start to get sparse, which results in an over-allocation of memory and slow training time. We run into additional problems when we try to reduce the dimensions. If we have a small number of dimensions, our data could overlap, resulting in a loss of data characteristics. You can see how that looks in one dimension and three dimensions. Overlap and sparsity make it difficult to determine the underlying patterns. However, with the proper number of dimensions, the patterns become much clearer\r\n",

        "> It’s important to know that an Autoencoder is not the only dimension reduction method in Machine Leaning. Principal Component Analysis (or PCA) has been around for a long time, and is a classic algorithm for dimensionality reduction. Take a look at the data separation outputs for the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. These charts show the image data after reducing their dimensions to 2 dimensions. The left output is from PCA. The output on the right is from an autoencoder. As you can see, it’s easier to discern the data with the autoencoder’s output. \r\n",

By now, you should understand that an autoencoder can extract key image features, improve training times of other networks, and improve the separability of reduced datasets when compared to other methods.For these reasons, the autoencoder was a breakthrough in the unsupervised learning research field.\r\n",

        ">Hello, and welcome! In this video, we’ll be examining the architecture of autoencoders and show you how autoencoders work. An autoencoder neural network is supposed to represent the images in a dataset with a low dimension feature set. For example, it extracts the most important features of faces, for an arbitrary task such as face recognition. Also, it is supposed to do it in an unsupervised manner, that is, “feature extraction” without provided labels for images. Now, let’s see how Authoencoders actually work. An autoencoder is an artificial neural network that’s designed to find important features by recreating the given input. Generally speaking, the main goal of Autoencoders is to take unlabeled inputs, encode them, and then try to reconstruct them afterwards, based on the most valuable features identified in the data. In fact, Autoencoders are based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, or in other words, Restricted Boltzmann Machines are a type of Autoencoder.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">So, what is the difference between Autoencoders and Restricted Boltzmann Machines -- or RBMs, for short? Well, most autoencoders are shallow networks with an input layer, a few hidden layers, and an output layer. RBMs, on the other hand, are autoencoders with only two layers. Also, Autoencoders differ from Restricted Boltzmann Machines because they use a deterministic approach, rather than a stochastic approach.\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">Ok, let’s take a closer look at the architecture of autoencoders. An autoencoder can be divided into two parts, the encoder and the decoder. The encoder needs to compress the representation of an input. In this case, we’re going to compress the face of our actor, moving from 2000-dimensions of data to only 30 dimensions. The decoder is a reflection of the encoder's network. It works to recreate the input as accurately as it can. It has an important role during training, and that is to force the autoencoder to select the most important features in the compressed representation. As you can see, we really don’t care about the reconstructed image in this network. What we do care about, though, is the code layer values, which represents the input layer. That is, if the network has learned enough that it can generate the replica of input images only based on the code-layer value, then, this vector of size 30, is good enough as the feature set to represent the input image. Therefore, after the training is complete, you can use the encoded data that has been dimensionally-reduced for the application of your choosing. This can include clustering, classification, or visualization of your data. So, as you can see, the Autoencoder can be considered as an unsupervised feature extraction technique for different machine learning algorithms. \r\n",

        "\r\n",
        ">So, how do Autoencoders learn? Autoencoders use back-propagation in their learning process. The metric used to assess the quality of the network is loss, which is the amount of information lost in the reconstruction of the input. The squared error of reconstruction for a single sample is the average of the squared error of the reconstructed image for all dimensions. The goal is to minimize the loss, so that we have an output that’s as close to the input as possible. At this point, you should have a better understanding of the structure and applications of autoencoders. \r\n",
